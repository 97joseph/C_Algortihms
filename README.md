12.1 The Subset-Sum Problem (Part A - For
ints)
Parts A and B are required. Part C is optional and is worth 2 points
extra credit (but must be submitted in addition to Part A and Part
B). Make sure you have read and understood both modules A and B of
this week before submitting this assignment.
Part A (required) - The Subset Sum Problem For Ints
Create a simple main() and complete other needed globe functions and class methods to solve
the subset sum problem for any vector of ints. Here is an example of the set-up. You would ll in
the actual code that makes it happen.
int main()
{
int target = 0;
vector dataSet;
vector choices;
int k, j, numSets, max, masterSum, newSum, bestSublist;
bool foundPerfect, needAlgorithm;
dataSet.push_back(20); dataSet.push_back(12);
dataSet.push_back(22);
dataSet.push_back(15); dataSet.push_back(25);
dataSet.push_back(19); dataSet.push_back(29);
dataSet.push_back(18);
dataSet.push_back(11); dataSet.push_back(13);
dataSet.push_back(17);
choices.clear();
cin >> target;
cout << "Target time: " << target << endl;

// code provided by student
//
//
choices[bestSublist].showSublist();
return 0;
}
The local variables you see above are not required; they come from my solution. If you want to
use different local variables, feel free.
Your output style may be different from mine. However, in order to receive the credit points, you
need to modify your code to match the output of the Auto Grader. Run the exact case as above
rst in the Develop mode and show enough other runs to prove your algorithm works, and also
show at least one run that does not meet target, exactly. Also, provide a special test to quickly
dispose of the case in which the target is larger than the sum of all elements in the master set.
This way, any target that is too large will not have to sit through a long and painful algorithm.
Demonstrate that this works by providing at least one run that seeks a target larger than the
sum of all master set elements.
You are not nding all solutions, just one representative solution. There may be other subsets
that do the job, but our algorithm only nds the one. Please do implement the exact algorithm
presented in our Canvas modules to generate the same output as the Auto Grader.
Ex. For the target input:
180
The output will be:
Target time: 180
Sublist -----------------------------
sum: 179
array[0] = 20, array[1] = 12, array[3] = 15, array[4] = 25,
array[5] = 19, array[6] = 29, array[7] = 18, array[8] = 11,
array[9] = 13, array[10] = 17

Note the target is not precisely met in this case. Usually it is, so if you vary the target, you'll nd
that you can get a perfectly matching sum. Also note this solution doesn't contain array[2].
Please make sure to implement the algorithm presented in our modules (not your own
algorithm) so your code will produce exactly the same sublists as in the Auto Grader's solutions.
Once you are satised with your runs in the the Develop mode, switch to Submit mode and click
"Submit for grading". Note: for the rst couple of weeks in this course, you would have max of 10
tries. This limit may be reduced over time to encourage you to do enough test in the 
mode. Please don't over use the Submit mode unless you are ready to submit. Your nal score
will be recorded and sent back to Canvas based on your last submission.


class Sublist
I have prompted you with all the essential details of the class Sublist that will support your
algorithm. I'll add a couple more hints:


To create an empty Sublist (which is the rst thing you need to do in order to prime the
pump) just instantiate one Sublist object. By denition, it represents an empty set, since it
will have no elements in its internal indices array list.


The addItem() member function is clearly the most interesting of the outstanding instance
methods. In that method you will have to create a new Sublist object whose sum is the
sum of the calling object plus the value of the new item added.

 This will require a slightly
different syntax for an int data set than it will for an iTunesEntry data set. In the latter
case, you'll need to get specic inside addItem() about what value within iTunesEntry you
are adding. 

This means addItem() is going to have syntax that ties it rmly to the
underlying data set. That's okay for this part and the next, but not for option C.
Part A run output (test cases) requirement
Required Targets: 1, 67, 180, 200, 1000
Other Targets will be checked by the Auto Grader.
