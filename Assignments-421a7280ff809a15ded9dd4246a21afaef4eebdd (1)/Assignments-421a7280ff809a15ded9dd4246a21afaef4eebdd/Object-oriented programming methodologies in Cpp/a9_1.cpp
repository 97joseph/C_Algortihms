Description: This program uses a fraction class and its member functions
			 to perform arithmetic operations on 2 fractions, for multiplication,
			 addition, subtraction and division and simplifies them.
			 The class and its member functions are declared in the specification file
			 and the memeber funcrtions are defined in the implemntation file. The client program
			 below makes use of the class to perform arithmetic.
